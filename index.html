            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello, I'm Michal Laskowski, an MSc Urban Planning graduate with a passion for front-end development. With a strong background in urban planning and civil engineering, I bring an analytical approach and problem-solving mindset to the world of web development. My professional journey includes valuable experience as a Town Planner in a telecommunications company, where I helped deploy digital connectivity (4G and 5G) across the UK. This work has deepened my understanding of the digital landscape and further fueled my interest in creating seamless online experiences.</p>
            <p>Currently, I'm focused on mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic and user-friendly websites. My goal is to blend my technical skills with my planning expertise to build impactful digital solutions that connect people, just as my previous work connected communities.</p>
            <p>Outside of coding, I’m an avid cyclist who enjoys exploring new trails and a seasoned traveler who has explored various parts of Europe and the US. I also have a passion for cooking and hiking, finding creativity and joy in the kitchen and tranquility in nature. These experiences have enriched my communication skills, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities.</p>
            <p>I’m excited to combine my technical skills, creativity, and diverse experiences to build innovative digital experiences that make a difference.</p>
